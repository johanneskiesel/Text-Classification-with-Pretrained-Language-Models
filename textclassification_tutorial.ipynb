        "# A practical guide to multilingual large language  model (RoBERTa) classification\n",
        "\n",
        "This step-by-step tutorial provides a gentle introduction to customizing (fine-tuning) a pre-trained multilingual language model (RoBERTa) for text classification tasks. It demonstrates how to use the model's existing knowledge to classify text accurately, even with a small set of labeled examples. It takes input as text documents and their corresponding labels for training, validating and testing. It covers using specialized models for English, German, and French, but employs XLM-RoBERTa, which can be used for over 100 languages.\n",

        "\n",
        "In text-classification we try to assign a property to a text.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example we are interested in classifying texts that are about fruits. We could easily find a dictionary with all fruits (e.g.: 'Apple', 'Banana', 'Pear' etc.). Everytime we recognize a word from this dictionary in a text we know this text is about fruits, right? However, this might not be true all the time. For example \"Apple designed the new pencil pro.\" is not about the fruit 'Apple' although we would recognize it as such with our dictionary approach. So the context of the word might be helpful (more on this later). Furthermore, dictionaries work only for the language in the dictionary. However, we aim for multilingual approaches in this tutorial and will thus replace dictionaries with AI methods later in this tutorial.\n",
        "\n",
        "Classification is obviously transferable to more than just fruits. People try to classify the sentiment of a text, the stance towards an entity expressed in a text, the topic of a text, the expressed emotion in a text, and many many more."
