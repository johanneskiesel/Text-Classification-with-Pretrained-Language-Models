# A Step-By-Step Guide to Text Classification by Fine-tuning Large Language Model (RoBERTa)

To take this tutorial we recommend to use an environment with access to a GPU with at least 16 GB VRAM, like Google Colaboratory. See the [Methods Hub page](https://doi.org/10.71627/Text-Classification-with-Pretrained-Language-Model) for links to open the tutorial in supported online environments.

To take this tutorial on a local machine, you need to have Python 3.7 or above and Jupyter notebooks installed. Then open the [textclassification_tutorial.ipynb notebook](textclassification_tutorial.ipynb) in the Jupyter web interface.
