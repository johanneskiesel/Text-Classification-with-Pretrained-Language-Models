# A Step-By-Step Guide to Text Classification by Fine-tuning Large Language Model (RoBERTa)

To follow this tutorial, ensure the following:
- Python >= 3.7 installed.
- Install required libraries by running:

  ```bash
  pip install -r binder/requirements.txt
  ```

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Set up the tutorial working environment (as explained in Environment Setup section)
3. Open the notebook [textclassification_tutorial.ipynb](textclassification_tutorial.ipynb)
4. Execute the cells sequentially to preprocess data, fine-tune the model, and perform evaluations.

The tutorial also runs with [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Stephan-Linzbach/Text-Classification-with-Pretrained-Language-Models/blob/main/textclassification_tutorial.ipynb).
